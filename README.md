# Data-manipulation-and-Tree-structures

I was given a problem statement(attached) to solve using python. I had to read .txt files from structured directories, edit them according to the conditions mentioned in the problem statement and then create the appropriate directory structure and save the output files accordingly.

This is my approach of solving it.
